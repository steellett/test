                                <h3>What is <span>Levitra?</span> </h3>
                                <p>

                                    <span>Levitra</span> is a therapeutic drug used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men. It is designed to be used alongside sexual stimulation to assist men with sexual functioning issues to achieve and maintain
                                    an erection. <span>Levitra</span> does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. It is recommended that patients using <span>Levitra</span> should speak to their doctor about the options that they can use to
                                    practice safe sex. Vardenafil is the active ingredient in<span> Levitra</span> used to treat impotence, or the inability to maintain or get an erection. <span>Levitra</span> belongs to a class of medications called
                                    PDE or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Combined with sexual stimulation, it works to improve the flow of blood. Levitra does not cure erectile dysfunction or create sexual desire. <span>Levitra</span> is not an aphrodisiac.</p>

                                <h3>When is <span>Levitra</span> used?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <span>Levitra</span> or Vardenafil may be prescribed as one of many options available to treat erectile dysfunction in men. Usually, it is given as a tablet that rapidly disintegrates in the mouth without water. The
                                    substance is taken as needed before sexual intercourse to improve the chances of maintaining and getting an erection in a male patient. <span>Levitra</span> should be taken at least 60 minutes before sexual activity,
                                    and it should not be taken more than once every twenty-four hours. Because this medication can interact negatively with other substances, it is crucial to speak to a doctor if you are taking certain medications, herbal,
                                    prescribed, or over the counter. Most doctors will start patients on an average dose of <span>Levitra</span> and then gradually adjust their consumption of the tablets to suit their individual needs. If you are taking
                                    the tablets that disintegrate rapidly, your doctor will not be able to change the dose. Speak to your doctor if <span>Levitra</span> is not working well for you. They may switch you to the regular tablets instead. </p>

                                <h3>How do you use Levitra?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <span>Levitra</span> or Vardenafil is either available as a rapidly-dissolving tablet that will disintegrate in your mouth without water, or as a regular pill. You must read the patient information leaflet provided
                                    by your doctor or Pharmacist before taking Levitra, and every time you are given a refill. If you have any questions, speak to your doctor. <span>Levitra</span> in both of its available forms is taken by mouth, as directed
                                    by your doctor. Take this medication with food, or without food depending on your preferences, around 60 minutes before sexual activity. Do not take <span>Levitra</span> more than once a day and remember to keep doses
                                    24 hours apart. Avoid drinking grapefruit juice or eating grapefruit when using this medication unless your pharmacist or doctor says that you will be able to do so safely. Grapefruit increases the risk of experiencing
                                    adverse side effects with this medication. The effect of <span>Levitra</span> should not be lessened when drinking alcohol. However, alcohol can make it more difficult for some men to get an erection, so it's best not
                                    to drink too much.</p>

                                <h3>What dosages are available?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <span>Levitra</span> is available in dosages of 20mg, 10mg, 5mg, and 2.5mg depending on your individual needs. Your doctor will prescribe your Vardenafil based on their knowledge of any other medicines you're taking,
                                    your medical condition, your response to treatment and other factors. Make sure that you speak to your pharmacist or doctor about all other products you use before getting your <span>Levitra</span> prescription. Most
                                    men find that the 10mg dose of the Vardenafil active ingredient is enough. However, if the dose doesn't work as you were expecting, your doctor may recommend taking it at different times of the day. If you still have
                                    trouble getting and maintaining an erection, your doctor may suggest increasing the dosage.
